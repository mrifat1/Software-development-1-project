This is my first year SOFTWARE DEVELOPEMNET PROJECT. 
My first project that is so simply done in C language. 
This is a simple quiz game project which consists of answering some various questions from random educational and sports and International types.
There are a few questions now. If needed, we can add some more from any types.
RUN the project in codeblocks/sublime text or any IDE you prefer which support c/c++ .
